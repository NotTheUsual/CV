# CV

I spent the last year and a half (or so) working as a freelance web designer, and became slightly tired of not being able to control how anything I worked on, well, worked. So I've made the switch to development through the course detailed below, and can now pretty happily control the functioning of web apps made with Rails or Sinatra. I'm now looking for a junior development role to help me learn far, far more.

## Recent Training

I recently spent 12 weeks at Makers Academy, an intensive 12-week training program for web development, ultimately focussed on Ruby on Rails. Over the course of the 12 weeks, we learnt Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, some Javascript and various agile techniques including test-driven development and pair programming. The results of that course make up the majority of the work on this account. Take a look around to get a better sense of what it involved.

### Notable Projects

| ------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| Final Project. Rails apps that aim to provide a health dashboard. Soma is an API that parses and stores blood test data. Somatra is a sample client app that makes use of that data using D3.js, and pulls in other sources of information for context (using e.g. the Moves API). | Instagram-like. Rails app that lets you upload photos to a public feed with Paperclip. Uses EXIF data to plot photos on a map. Uses Stripe to allow for purchasing photos. | Twitter-like. Sinatra app that lets you upload short messages to a public feed. Also allows you to reply to other messages. |

<small>Cambridge doesn't really count Photography AS-level as a real subject but I almost feel as though of all the subjects I took that year, it probably best prepared me for university and the work I do now. The course was oriented around a series of large projects with all the work we did over the course of the year added to a sketchbook for each project. Each week you pick a new area that interests you, or a new subject to learn about, and just play around in that area of art until you've learned what you need to. You're constantly trying to work out what small things you need to teach yourself in the service of some larger goal. Those kinds of techniques, making sure you're happy with constantly having to (and wanting to) search for new sources of information, are unbelievably valuable.</small>
